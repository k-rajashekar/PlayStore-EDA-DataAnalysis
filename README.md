# PlayStore-EDA-DataAnalysis
This project performs a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Google Play Store app data and user reviews to uncover what makes an app successful. By combining quantitative metrics (ratings, installs, prices) with qualitative feedback (user sentiments), it provides valuable business insights for developers, marketers, and product strategists.
