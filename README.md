ðŸ“± Google Play Store App & User Review Analysis
This repository contains an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on Google Play Store apps and user reviews. The goal is to identify key drivers of app engagement, user satisfaction, and market performance through insightful visualizations and statistical observations.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
To analyze app-level metadata and user sentiment data from the Google Play Store to discover:

What types of apps dominate the market?

How do pricing, size, and category affect ratings?

How do user sentiments relate to app success?

What factors most influence app installs, ratings, and reviews?

ðŸ§  Thought Process
This project began with a real-world question: Why do some apps succeed while others fail?
With over 3 million apps available, we wanted to explore what patterns exist in high-performing apps. We approached this by combining app metadata with real user review sentiments to see how technical attributes align with public perception.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The project uses two datasets:

googleplaystore.csv: Contains metadata like app name, category, rating, reviews, size, installs, type, price, and more.

googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv: Includes textual user reviews along with precomputed sentiment polarity and subjectivity.

Together, these datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative insights into app success factors.
